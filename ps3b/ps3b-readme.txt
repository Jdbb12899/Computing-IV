Hours to complete assignment: 3-hrs for ps3a (Mainly to figuring out draw)
                              2-hrs for ps3b (Had a NAN bug that alluded me)

Help Received: I used the information gleaned from class to build a template for my program, and then used the formulas from the princeston site to fill in those templates.

Serious Issues: I had an issue where I was getting NAN and making my planets disappear. I turns out when I was calculating Fx and Fy I was calculating the distance from one planet to itself, and eventually dividing by 0. I was aware of this being a possibility and had the 'if' statement to do something else if 'i' and 'j' were equal, but I never included an else portion so it did the math in that case anyways.
